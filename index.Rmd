## Description of the corpus:
* The corpus that I will use for my portfolio will consist of 150 opera songs and 150 musical songs. I will use pre-existing playlists from Spotify, with tracks selected from different popular operas and musicals. If needed, I will remove or add some tracks myself. I chose this corpus because I have always been fascinated by musicals. More recently, I was introduced to operas and I recognized the same compelling drama I appreciate in musicals. Opera songs and musical songs both mainly serve to tell a story, but have very different styles. The main difference between the two is that operas consists of classical music, while musicals can be written in different music genres. Still, I wonder if opera and musical music share certain aspects, because they both have such a strong narrative function.
* The natural comparison points in my corpus are genre and artist. I expect that there is a clear difference between the genres of operas and musicals. I also expect that musical tracks have higher tempo and danceability. I think that the speechiness and liveness of the two groups is generally the same. I am not sure about the energy and loudness.
* Because adding music from *every* opera and musical would create a very big corpus, tracks from some operas and musicals are essentially missing (also because most operas and musicals have had a lot of productions with different artists/conductors/musicians). This means that my corpus does not cover the whole genre. Furthermore, Spotify's pre-existing playlists generally include only the well-known (classical) operas and musicals, leaving out smaller productions.
* Typical tracks in the corpus:
  * Habanera – Carmen: for me, this is a typical opera song with very high notes that everyone knows.
  * La donne e mobile – Rigoletto: again, this is a very famous song. I think the grandeur of this song is typical for opera music.
  * One Day More - Les Miserables: this song is very dramatic and has multiple singers, which is typical for musical songs.
  * You Can't Stop The Beat - Hairspray: the happiness and danceability of this song is typical for musical songs.
* Atypical tracks in the corpus:
  * Summertime - Porgy and Bess: this is a jazz song, which is a different genre than most opera songs.
  * Ride of the Valkyries - Die Walkure: this song has no lyrics, which is atypical for an opera song.
  * Totally Fucked - Spring Awakening: this comes close to a rock song, which is a different genre than most musical songs. 
  * Prologue - West Side Story: this song has no lyrics, which is atypical for a musical song.
